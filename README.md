## About App

This app is an online shopping platform that offers users a convenient way to browse and purchase products across various categories. Here are the key features and functionalities:

- **Authentication:** Users can sign up using their name, email, password, address, and phone number. They can also log in using their email and password. The app securely stores user IDs to keep them logged in across sessions. A logout option is available for users to sign out.

- **Product Listing:** The app displays product categories, allowing users to explore products within each category. Detailed product information, including descriptions and prices, is provided. Users can add products to their cart, adjust quantities, and remove items as needed.

- **Cart Management:** Users can view a summary of their cart, including the total order amount. They can proceed to place orders directly from the cart. Upon successful order placement, users receive a notification. The app also maintains an order history for users to reference.

- **User Profile:** User profiles feature essential information such as name, email, address, and phone number. Each user is assigned a unique circular profile image. Users have the option to update their GPS coordinates for location-based services.

- **UI and Implementation:** The app utilizes RecyclerView for efficient list display and ensures secure communication with an authentication token for logged-in users. An "About this app" section credits the app's contributors. The app integrates with the fake store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/) for data retrieval, including user details, product categories, products, and order history.

The app is developed using Kotlin and incorporates libraries like Retrofit for network requests, Glide for image loading, and Room for local data storage. It follows an MVVM architecture, separating UI elements from business logic and data handling. Overall, the app delivers a seamless shopping experience with robust features, intuitive interface design, and efficient implementation.
